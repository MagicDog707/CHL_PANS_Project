## Description
Integrate metabolomics and proteomics data from PANS. Perform classification of patients based on the two types of data, and extract biomarkers that maximize classification performance.
### Abstract
PANS is a pediatric disorder that involves symptoms such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), tics, anxiety attacks, depression, and sleep problems. 
The causes of the onset of this disease are probably related to an immune response to a bacterial or viral infection; therefore, current treatments include antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, and antidepressants.
Our project is based on two data sets: metabolic data and proteomic data. Most of the patients they refer to are in common. Then, as we described in the Method section, we merged these two datasets into a new one to try the a-priori methodology.
Hence, our aim is to integrate omics data to maximize the classification performance extracting the biomarkers.
